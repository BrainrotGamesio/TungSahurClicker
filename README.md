## How to Play: A Comprehensive Guide

Tung Sahur Clicker is an incremental (idle) clicker H5 game designed for quick, satisfying gameplay loops.

*   **Platform:** H5 Game (Playable in web browsers on PC and Mobile)
*   **Objective:** Tap to earn coins, unlock upgrades, automate your earnings, and watch Tung Sahur's hilarious dance performances.

### Basic Gameplay

*   **Tapping/Clicking:** The primary action. Repeatedly tap or click on the screen (or specifically on Tung Sahur) to make him dance and generate coins. Each tap contributes to your coin total.

### Progression System

*   **Earning Coins:** Coins are the main currency used to purchase upgrades.
*   **Unlocking Upgrades:** As you earn more coins, you'll be able to afford various upgrades that significantly impact your gameplay.

### Upgrades and Automation

*   **Coin-Per-Tap (CPT) Upgrades:** Increase the number of coins you earn with each manual tap.
*   **Coins-Per-Second (CPS) / Automation Upgrades:** These are crucial for idle progression. Invest in upgrades that automatically generate coins for you over time, even when you're not actively tapping.
*   **Multiplier Upgrades:** Some upgrades might boost your CPT or CPS by a certain percentage or offer temporary multipliers (like the 2x bonus).

## Tips and Strategies for High Scores

Want to become a Tung Sahur Clicker tycoon? Here are some essential tips and strategies:

### Focus on Early Upgrades

*   In the early stages, prioritize upgrades that significantly boost your **coin-per-tap (CPT)**. This will accelerate your initial coin accumulation and help you unlock more powerful upgrades faster.

### Prioritize Automation

*   As soon as **automation upgrades (CPS - coins per second)** become available and affordable, invest in them. This is key to maximizing your earnings, especially when you're not actively playing (idle progression).

### Optimize Tap Speed (Manual Play)

*   When actively playing, your tap speed directly impacts your earnings.
    *   **PC:** Use your mouse and click rapidly.
    *   **Mobile:** Use multiple fingers if comfortable for faster tapping.
    *   Look for any in-game cues or sweet spots for tapping.

### Balanced Investments

*   Don't pour all your coins into a single upgrade type. Strive for a balance:
    *   Boost your CPT for active play.
    *   Boost your CPS for idle play.
    *   Invest in multiplier upgrades when they offer good value.

### Regular Check-ins for Idle Gains

*   Idle games reward consistency. Log in frequently (even for short periods) to:
    *   Collect your accumulated offline/idle earnings.
    *   Reinvest those coins into new upgrades to keep your progress snowballing.

### Master the 2x Bonus Multiplier

*   The game features an "addictive 2x bonus active with regular clicks."
    *   Understand how this bonus is triggered and maintained.
    *   Strategically time your active play sessions to maximize uptime of this valuable multiplier.

## Advanced Strategies

### Strategic Use of Prestige/Reset (If Applicable)

*   Many clicker games feature a "Prestige" or reset mechanic. If Tung Sahur Clicker implements this:
    *   **Understand the Benefits:** Resetting usually means starting over but with powerful permanent bonuses (e.g., a global earning multiplier).
    *   **Timing is Key:** Learn the optimal time to prestige. Resetting too early or too late can slow down overall progress. Look for community advice on this.

### Event Participation

*   If the game introduces time-limited events or special challenges:
    *   **Participate Actively:** Events often offer unique rewards, bonus currencies, or temporary powerful upgrades that can give you a significant edge.

### Community Engagement

*   **Join the Discord:** Connect with other players on our [Official Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zAkUQVH3).
*   **Share & Learn:** Share your own strategies and learn new optimization tips from experienced players. The community is often the best source for cutting-edge tactics.
